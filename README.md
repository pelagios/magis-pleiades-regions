# Polygons for Pleiades Regions

These polygon geometries were digitized from Barrington Atlas rasters (georegistered and supplied by the
[Ancient World Mapping Center AWMC](http://awmc.unc.edu/)) by Pedar Foss at Depauw University in 2007 for the
[MAGIS project](http://cgma.depauw.edu/MAGIS/). The data was made available by Pedar Foss for free redistribution,
with attribution (Copyright AWMC & Foss, CC-BY).

With support from the [Pelagios project](http://pelagios-project.blogspot.co.uk),
[Stuart Eve](http://www.dead-mens-eyes.org/) has added [Pleiades](http://pleiades.stoa.org)
identifiers in 2015 and converted the geometries to Pelagios RDF Format.
[Jean-Marc Montanier](https://github.com/montanier) has kindly provided a converter to GeoJSON.

The data is available in two versions:

* GeoJSON

* RDF/Turtle, formatted according to the [Pelagios Gazetteer Interconnection
  Format](https://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-cookbook/wiki/Pelagios-Gazetteer-Interconnection-Format),
  intended to be used as a "patch file", i.e. to amend a full [Pleiades data dump](http://pleiades.stoa.org/downloads).
